Sensory input scene: The man's mentor watches him as he drinks his coffee and starts to wake up. "You've come a long way," he says. "I'm proud of you." The man nods and finishes his coffee. He stands up and stretches. "I can do this," he says. "I know you can," his mentor replies. "Now let's go." They walk out into the bright morning sun, each step taking them closer to their goal.
