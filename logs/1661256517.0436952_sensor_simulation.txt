Sensory input scene: The man is walking through the park, lost in thought. He can't believe he made that last move, it was a mistake that cost him the game. He's never been good at chess, but he always enjoys playing. He's lost in thought as he walks, so he doesn't notice the other man until he's right in front of him. "Hey, sorry, I didn't see you there," the man says. "It's okay," the other man replies. "I was just lost in thought myself." They stand there for a moment, each lost in their own thoughts. Finally, the man breaks the silence. "Well, I should get going," he says. "It was nice playing with you." "Yeah, same here," the other man replies. They say goodbye and go their separate ways. The man's mind is still racing as he walks home, replaying the game over and over in his head.
