Sensory input scene: The two men are playing chess in Central Park and having a conversation afterwards. One man is trying to figure out where he went wrong in the game, while the other is trying to give him advice. "You can't beat yourself up too much," the second man says. "It's just a game." "I know, but I can't help it," the first man replies. "I've never been good at chess, but I always enjoy playing." "Well, I think you did pretty well," the second man says. "You just made one mistake." The first man nods and thanks the second man for his advice. They say goodbye and go their separate ways.
