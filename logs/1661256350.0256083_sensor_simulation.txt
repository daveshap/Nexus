Sensory input scene: The men sit in silence for a moment, their breaths coming in short gasps. Then, they stand up and shake hands. The game is over. They pack up their chess set and leave the park, the sun now casting a bright light over the city. They walk in silence, each man lost in his own thoughts. Finally, they reach the man's apartment and say goodbye. The man goes inside and the other man walks away, the sound of the chess pieces clacking echoing in his mind.
