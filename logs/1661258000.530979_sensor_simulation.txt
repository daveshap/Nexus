Sensory input scene: The next morning, the man's mentor comes to his room to wake him up. "Hey, sleepyhead," he says. "Today's the day you make your big presentation." The man nods groggily, and his mentor hands him a cup of coffee. "Drink this," he says. "You're going to need it." The man takes a sip of coffee and starts to wake up. His mentor watches him and smiles. "You've come a long way," he says. "I'm proud of you." The man nods and finishes his coffee. He stands up and stretches. "I can do this," he says. "I know you can," his mentor replies. "Now let's go."
