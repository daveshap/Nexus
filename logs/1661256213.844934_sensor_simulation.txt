Sensory input scene: The men continue to play chess as the sun sets and the park empties out. They are the only ones left. The lights of the city come on as the darkness deepens. The men are silhouetted against the skyline, their chess pieces illuminated by the lampposts. They continue to play, their concentration intense. The only sound is the occasional clacking of the chess pieces.
