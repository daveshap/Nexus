Sensory input scene: The men continue to play chess into the night, their concentration intense. The only sound is the occasional clacking of the chess pieces. As the men play, the skyline changes as the lights of the city come on. The men are silhouetted against the skyline, their chess pieces illuminated by the city lights. As the men play, they begin to talk, their voices low and intense. They discuss the game, their strategies, their moves. They argue and debate, their voices rising and falling in the darkness. The only sound is the clacking of the chess pieces and the men's voices, echoing in the empty park.
