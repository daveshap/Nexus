# Nexus REST Microservice

Stream of Consciousness REST microservice. Nexus of thought for artificial cognition.

- Rapid prototyping. Not for full-scale operations (yet)
- Biomimetic. Models human recall (associative and temporal memory)

Still a work in progress. Will be optimized for scale in the future. New endpoints will be added for different types of recall.

## Usage

Look at `test.py` for examples
